Solutions written during the "live" Advent of Code 2021.  They were sufficient to obtain [50 Stars](advent-of-code-2021-50-stars.png), but I was clearly getting a bit sick of things at (or before!) Day 24, which is a dreadful half-assed solution that takes 15 mins(!) to run!

Generally, the solutions here are not very good quality, with e.g. little effort to de-duplicate Part 1 and Part 2 for each day (I generally just copy-n-pasted Part 1 as a basis for Part 2!).
