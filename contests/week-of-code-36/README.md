Third Contest I took part in (February 2018).

Got perfect solutions for all but the Expert one which, alas, really required some knowledge that I didn't have.

Still placed **55th** out of **12748** participants ([link](https://www.hackerrank.com/results/w36/ssjgz)), achieving **Gold** so not the end of the world :)
