First-ever Codechef Competitive Programming Contest (August 2019).  Starting off in Division 2 (the default for new competitors).

Got perfect solutions for all Problems, though did not tackle the "Challenge" question, as I don't find them interesting (they're unsolvable, by design, and a test of your ability to find good *heuristics*, rather than good *algorithms*.

Gained **221** in Ratings, taking me from the default **2\*** to **3\***.
