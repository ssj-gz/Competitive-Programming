Second-ever Codechef Competitive Programming Contest (September 2019).  Still in Division 2 (the default for new competitors).

Link: https://www.codechef.com/SEPT19B

Got perfect solutions for all but hardest Problem (though I'm continuing to ignore the "Challenge" questions).  Observation: even in Division 2, Codechef's harder Problems are probably more difficult than Hackerrank's "Expert" Problems!

Gained **186** in Ratings, taking me from the **3\*** to **4\*** and from **Division 2** to **Division 1**.
