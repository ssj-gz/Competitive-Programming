My first-ever Competitive Programming Contest, way back in November 2017!

Managed to get perfect solutions on all Problems, including the Expert-rated one, but unfortunately didn't get the maximum marks as "Matrix Land" took me more than 24 hours to complete (the maximum marks attainable for a Problem - even with a perfect solution - is reduced every 24 hours).

Placed **61st** out of **9418** participants ([link](https://www.hackerrank.com/results/w35/ssjgz?h_r=profile)), achieving **Gold** - not bad for a first attempt!
