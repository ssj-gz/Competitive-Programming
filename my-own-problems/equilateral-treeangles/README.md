This was my first-ever accepted Problem and was eventually published as "Chef and Gordon Ramsay 2" (**CHGORAM2**) in Codechef's **FEB20** Long Challenge ([link](https://www.codechef.com/FEB20A/problems/CHGORAM2)) where it had only **66** successful completions and just **3.25%** Success Rate - not bad for a first attempt!

It was originally created in **July 2019**—inspired by my dissatisfaction with Hackerrank's [Find the Nearest Clone](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-nearest-clone/) Problem—and given the name "Equilateral Treeangles" (wince).  By a bizarre coincidence, the very [next](https://www.codechef.com/AUG19B) Long Challenge (**AUG19B**) contained a Problem called ["Chef and Gordon Ramsay"](https://www.codechef.com/AUG19B/problems/CHGORAM) (**CHGORAM**) which looked heart-stoppingly similar to "Equilateral Treeangles", being concerned as it was with triples of nodes on a Tree and their arrangements.  Thankfully, though, the two Problems turned out to be entirely dissimilar and, better, I got to rework "Equilateral Treeangles" into a sequel to **CHGORAM** (renaming it to **CHGORAM2** in the process) and piggy-back on an existing Problem statement to save me having to dream up a silly background story for it from scratch! 

Unlike my other two Problems, the [Editorial](https://discuss.codechef.com/t/chgoram2-editorial/53535) was written by a [third-party](https://discuss.codechef.com/u/tmwilliamlin), which is just as well as my own solution to this Problem was far less elegant than his!
