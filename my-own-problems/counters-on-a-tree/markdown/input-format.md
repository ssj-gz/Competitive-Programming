The first line contains the number of vertices, $N$ in the original tree, $T$.

The next $N$ lines each consist of a single number $c_i$; that is, the number of coins on the vertex $i$ when we start a game.

The next $N-1$ lines each consist of a pair of integers $u$ and $v$, separated by a space, indicating that the vertices numbered $u$ and $v$ are joined by an edge in $T$.
