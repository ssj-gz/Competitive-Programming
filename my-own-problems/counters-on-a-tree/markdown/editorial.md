# PROBLEM:
Bob and Alice are playing a game on a board which is a tree, $T$.  Each node of $T$ has some number of coins placed on it.  For a node $R$, define $\textit{game}(T, R)$ to be the game played on $T$ in which players take turns to move a coin from some node other than $R$ strictly towards $R$.  The first player unable to make a move loses the game.  For each $R$, find the winner of $game(T,R)$, assuming both players play perfectly.

# QUICK EXPLANATION:
Should contain concise explanation, clear to advanced coders.

# EXPLANATION:
Very detailed explanation ideally with code snippets.
Ideally editorialist should write his own solution
and write editorial strictly following his solution.

For adding mathematical expressions, LaTeX is required, which is nicely explained at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics

Some examples of latex here. (Latex is always enclosed in between $ sign)

$ans = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} a_i^k \bmod M$

$\frac{num}{den}$

$\leq$, $\geq$, $\neq$, $\pm$

# ALTERNATE EXPLANATION:
Could contain more or less short descriptions of possible other approaches.
