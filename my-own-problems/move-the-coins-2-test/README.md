Chronologically, this was my third accepted Problem and was eventually published as "Move the Coins - Creating Tests" (**MVCN2TST**) in Codechef's **SEPT20** Long Challenge ([link](https://www.codechef.com/SEPT20A/problems/MVCN2TST)) where it had only **72** successful completions and just **3.46%** Success Rate.

It was originally created in **April 2020**, inspired by actual problems encountered while creating the [Testcase Generator](../abandoned/move-the-coins-2/testcase-generator/) for the Problem that was [_originally_](../abandoned/move-the-coins-2) known as "Move the Coins 2" (contrasted with the Problem that was [_actually_](../counters-on-a-tree) published as "Move the Coins 2"!).  I'm slightly ambivalent about is as a Problem: on the one hand it is an "onion" Problem where solving one sub-problem throws up another, harder, one (which I like), but on the other hand these sub-problems feel very contrived and artificial (which, frankly, they are).

Interestingly, during the **SEPT20** Contest preparation, it was almost unanimously viewed as being harder than its [sister-Problem](../counters-on-a-tree) from the same contest, but in fact it was the latter that turned out to be the hardest Problem in **SEPT20**.

As with [Move the Coins 2](../counters-on-a-tree), I also wrote the [Editorial](https://discuss.codechef.com/t/mvcn2tst-editorial/75366) for this one, again including [animations](markdown/animation-manim-source/) (courtesy of [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)), though I note that I haven't yet finished these animations off.  Naughty me.
