A short and concise description of the problem statement.

# QUICK EXPLANATION:
Should contain concise explanation, clear to advanced coders.

# EXPLANATION:
Very detailed explanation ideally with code snippets.
Ideally editorialist should write his own solution

For adding mathematical expressions, LaTeX is required, which is nicely explained at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics

Some examples of latex here. (Latex is always enclosed in between $ sign)

$ans = \sum_{i = 1}^{N} a_i^k \bmod M$

$\frac{num}{den}$

$\leq$, $\geq$, $\neq$, $\pm$

# ALTERNATE EXPLANATION:
Could contain more or less short descriptions of possible other approaches.
