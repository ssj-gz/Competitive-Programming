Misc C++ libraries for helping to generate testcases for my problems, plus misc scripts for e.g. verifying that a solution passes them, or for generating Problem Statement/ Editorial PDFs from Markdown.

This is all my code, with the exception of `testlib.h`, which is adapted from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeMirzayanov/testlib/master/testlib.h).
