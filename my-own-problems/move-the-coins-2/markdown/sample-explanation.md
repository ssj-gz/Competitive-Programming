The initial tree $T$ looks like:

Query #1 $(4, 1)$ changes the parent of vertex $4$ from its original parent $3$ to its new parent $1$, which results in $\textit{transform}(T, (4, 1))$ below:

On the transformed tree resulting from this query, Alice wins if both players play optimally.

Query #2 $(6, 2)$ changes the parent of vertex $6$ from its original parent $4$ to its new parent $2$, which results in $\textit{transform}(T, (6, 2))$:

On the transformed tree resulting from this query, Bob wins.

Query #3 $(3,2)$ changes the parent of vertex $3$ from its original parent $1$ to its new parent $2$, resulting in $\textit{transform}(T, (3, 2))$:

On the transformed tree resulting from this query, Bob again is the winner if both players play optimally.

Only the $2$ queries #2 and #3 result in a win for Bob, so we output $2$ (the number of winning queries for Bob) on one line, then the winning query numbers ($2$ and $3$) on the next two lines.
