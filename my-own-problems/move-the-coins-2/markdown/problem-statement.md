In the original ["Move the Coins"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/move-the-coins/problem), Alice and Bob were playing a coin game on a tree, but found they could easily predict who would win if they both played optimally.  Alice then suggested that Bob should answer queries about who would win on a transformed version of the tree, but they soon solved this problem, too.  This challenge makes things much harder by making a tiny tweak to the rules of the game!

Specifically:

Alice and Bob are playing a game with coins on a tree $T$ over $N$ vertices numbered $1...N$.  The vertex numbered $i$ initially has $c_i$ *coins* on it.  The rules of the game are as follows:

-  The players take turns to make a *valid move*, with Alice taking the first turn.
- If the current player cannot make a valid move, then the game ends and the other player is deemed the winner.
- A *valid move* for a player is to pick a vertex $v \ne 1$ which has at least one coin in it, and move a single coin from $v$ some non-zero number of steps along the path from $v$ to the vertex $1$. (This is the tiny tweak to the rules of the original ["Move the Coins"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/move-the-coins/problem) game.)


For example, if the tree $T$ currently looks like this:

Then the current player can pick a coin in any of vertices $v = 2, 4$ or $5$.  Let's assume he picks the coin in $5$, as shown below; then he can move the coin $X$ steps towards $1$, where $X=1,2$ or $3$, ending up in vertices $4$, $2$ or $1$, respectively:

Let's assume he moves the coin $X=2$ steps, ending up in vertex $2$.  Then the tree now looks like 


![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1521712073-48296db0ed-move-the-coins-2-example-move-example-3of3.png)

and it is the other player's turn to move.

In the tree $T$, for each vertex $v \ne 1$, let $p(v)$ be the *parent* of $v$ if we did a DFS from vertex $1$; in other words, $p(v)$ is the first vertex we'd encounter on the path from $v$ to vertex $1$.

For a tree $T'$ on vertices $1,2,...,N$, let $\textit{winner}(T')$ be whichever of Alice or Bob will win if both players play the game optimally on $T'$ and Alice moves first.

Alice and Bob soon figure out how to predict $\textit{winner}(T)$ for their original $T$ without even playing - it's even easier to do so than in the original ["Move the Coins"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/move-the-coins/problem)! - so to keep things interesting, Alice once again suggests that she'll pose Bob a range of $Q$ queries: each query $q_i=(u_i,v_i)$ (where $u_i$ and $v_i$ are vertices) describes a new tree $T(q_i)$ that is subtley different from $T$, and Bob has to decide who would be the winner if they played on this new tree i.e. find $\textit{winner}(T(q_i))$.  The new tree $T(q_i)$ for a query $q_i=(u_i,v_i)$ is formed as follows:

- Initially, $T(q_i)$ is set to be a copy of $T$.
- $T(q_i)$ is then modified by first removing the edge between $p(u_i)$ and $u_i$ and then adding a new edge between $v_i$ and $u_i$ i.e. $T(q_i)$ is a copy of $T$, but with $u_i$s *parent* now changed to be $v_i$.

Note that each vertex $x$ in $T(q_i)$ still has its original $c_x$ coins in it, and that the original $T$ is never altered.

Alice promises that for each of her queries $q_i$, the resulting $T(q_i)$ will be a connected tree on the original $N$ vertices.

You need to output, in sorted order, the numbers $i$ of the queries for which $T(q_i)$ is Bob.
