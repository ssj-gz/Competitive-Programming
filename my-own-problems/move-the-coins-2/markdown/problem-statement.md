A sequel to ["Move the Coins"](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/move-the-coins/problem), with a tiny twist :)

Bob and Alice are playing a board game.  The board is in the form of a tree $T$ with $N$ nodes, numbered from $1$ to $N$, and _rooted_ at node $1$. The game involves moving a set of *Coins* around the board, with each node $v$ having $c_v$ Coins on it at the beginning of the game. Define $\textit{game}(T)$ as the game with the following rules:

1. A copy of $T$ is taken, and for each $v=1,2,\dots N$, we ensure that there are precisely $c_v$ Coins on the node numbered $v$.
2. Bob and Alice now take turns to make a move, with Alice making the first move.
3. A move consists of taking a single Coin ($C$, say) from some node other than $1$ and moving it to an *allowed* node. If $v_C$ is the node that $C$ is currently on, then the set of allowed nodes for this $C$ is the set of $u \ne v_C$ on the shortest path between nodes $v_C$ and $1$ (**this is the "tiny twist" from the original Problem**).
4. If a player cannot make a move on their turn (i.e. because all the Coins are on node $1$), then the game ends and the other player is declared the winner.

For example, if the tree $T$ currently looks like this:

Then the current player can pick a Coin on any of nodes $v = 2, 4$ or $5$ (if there were any Coins on node $3$, picking one of those would also be an option). Let's assume they pick the Coin on $5$, as shown below; then they can move the Coin $X$ steps towards $1$, where $X=1,2$ or $3$, ending up on node $4$, $2$ or $1$, respectively:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-move-example2of3.png)

Let's assume they pick $X=2$, so they move the Coin to node $2$. Then the tree now looks like:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-move-example3of3.png)

and it is the other player's turn to move.

Let $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T))$ be whichever of Bob or Alice wins the $\textit{game}(T)$, assuming both players play perfectly.

Bob knows some elementary Game Theory, so given the _original tree_ $T_\textit{orig}$ and the initial distribution $c_v$ of Coins at the start of the game, he can easily decide $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T_\textit{orig}))$ without even having to play!  But as in the original Problem, Alice now gives him a set of _reparenting queries_ $q_i=(u_i, v_i)$, $i=1,2,\ldots\,Q$, and challenges him, for each query $q_i$, to find $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_i)))$, where $T(q_i)$ is the _transformed tree_ created from applying the reparenting query $q_i=(u_i, v_i)$ to the original tree $T_{\textit{orig}}$ as follows:

1. Take a copy of the original tree $T_{\textit{orig}}$, along with the $c_v$ Coins on each node $v$.
2. Since this tree is _rooted_ at 1, it makes sense to refer to a _parent_ of a node.  In our copy of $T_{\textit{orig}}$, sever the node $u_i$ from its original parent i.e. remove the edge between $u_i$ and its original parent.
3. _Re-parent_ the node $u_i$ to its _new parent_, $v_i$ i.e. add an edge between $u_i$ and $v_i$.

The resulting tree is our $T(q_i)$.

As an example, assume that the below is our $T_\textit{orig}$ with a set of $c_v$ giving the number of Coins on a node:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX-reparent1of2.png)

Assuming we want to apply the reparenting query $q=(u,v)=(6,3)$.  Then we compute $T((6,3))$ as follows:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX-reparent2of2.png)

Can you help Bob compute, for each of Alice's reparenting queries $q$, the winner of the game played on the transformed board $T(q)$?

More formally, Bob is given the following:

1. An original tree $T_\textit{orig}$
2. A list $c_i$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,N$ describing the number of Coins initially placed on node $v$ of $T_\textit{orig}$
3. A list of reparenting queries $q_i=(u_i, v_i)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,Q$

Let $\textit{BobWinQ}$ be the set of $i$ such that $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_i)))=\text{Bob}$; then you must compute the value:

$$
\sum\limits_{i \in \textit{BobWinQ}}2^i
$$

Since this value can be very large, please output it mod $10^9+7$.

### Input

- The first line of a testcase contains a single integer $N$.
- Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$ indicating that the nodes numbered $a$ and $b$ are connected by an edge.
- The next line of the testcase contains $N$ space-separated integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_N$, where $c_i$ denotes the number of Counters that should be placed on the the node numbered $i$ in the tree $T_{\textit{board}}$ at the beginning of a game.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of reparenting queries.
- For each $i=1,2,\dots,Q$, the $i^\text{th}$ of the next $Q$ lines consists of two space-separated integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ denoting the reparenting query $q_i=(u_i, v_i)$.

### Explanation

**Example case 1:** The original tree $T_{\textit{orig}}$ looks like this (the initial Coins specified by the $c_i$ have been added for clarity):

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX1-1of4.png)

The first query is $q_1=(u_1, v_1)=(2,3)$, and we construct the corresponding $T(q_1)$ as show below:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX1-2of4.png)

We see that $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_1)))$ is Alice TODO - explanation

The second query is $q_2=(u_2, v_2)=(3,1)$, and we construct the corresponding $T(q_2)$ as show below:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX1-3of4.png)

We see that $\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_2)))$ is Bob TODO - explanation,so we add $2$ to $\textit{BobWinQ}$.

The third and final query is $q_3=(u_3, v_3)=(3,2)$, and we construct the corresponding $T(q_3)$ as show below:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX1-4of4.png)

Alice wins the game played on $T(q_3)$ TODO - explanation.

So we have $\textit{BobWinQ}={2}$, so the sum we need to compute is

$$
\sum\limits_{i \in \textit{BobWinQ}}2^i = 2^2=4
$$

Taking this modulo $10^9+7$, the final answer for this testcase is $4$.

**Example case 2:** The original tree $T_{\textit{orig}}$ and the transformed trees for each of the three queries are as follows:

![image](http://campus.codechef.com/SITJMADM/content/MOVCOIN2-EX2.png)

It can be shown that:

$$
\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_1))) = \text{Bob}
$$
$$
\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_2))) = \text{Alice}
$$
$$
\textit{winner}(\textit{game}(T(q_3))) = \text{Bob}
$$

Thus, only $q_1$ and $q_3$ lead to Bob wins, so $\textit{BobWinQ}=\{1,3\}$, and the sum we need to compute is:

$$
\sum\limits_{i \in \textit{BobWinQ}}2^i = 2^1+2^3=2+8=10
$$

Taking this modulo $10^9+7$, the final answer for this testcase is $10$.
