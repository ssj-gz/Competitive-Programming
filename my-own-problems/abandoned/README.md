This directory is the graveyard for Problems that I created, but which I decided weren't ultimately good enough for Publishing.

The most common reason for this is the existence of "Cheat" solutions: solutions that are not asymptotically optimal, but for which testcases that cause them to exceed the time limits cannot sensibly be generated; Problems where the asymptotically optimal solution has a very high constant factor but the sub-optimal one has an extremely low one are a good example of this.  The existence of Cheat Solutions caused two of the three Problems to be abandoned.

The final commit message for each of the three Problems gives a more detailed reason for their abandonment.
