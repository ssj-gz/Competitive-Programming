The first line contains the number of vertices, $N$ in the original tree, $T$.

The next $N$ lines each consist of a single number $c_i$; that is, the number of coins on the vertex $i$.

The next $N-1$ lines each consist of a pair of integers $u$ and $v$, separated by a space, indicating that the vertices numbered $u$ and $i$ are joined by an edge in $T$.

The next line consists of the number $q$ of queries.

The next $q$ lines each consist of a pair of integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, giving the way that we transform the original tree $T$ to form the transformed tree.
