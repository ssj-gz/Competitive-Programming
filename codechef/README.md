Solutions from Codechef "Practice" section.

These are all fairly easy ones, as I usually only tackled a Problem if someone on the forums was having difficulty with it (many of the commit messages have a variant of "Someone asked for help with it, so doing it!" in them!) 

Solutions (some only partial, alas) to some harder Problems can be found in the Contests section:
